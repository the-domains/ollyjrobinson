Researchers, marketers, pretty much anyone with a passing interest in innovation: we all have one thing in common. When we need to understand how things are changing, we ask young people. 

Young people **know** things. 

Despite the haircuts, and the clothes, and the linguistic tics, young people have always constituted a wealth of information about where we're headed. 

They're almost always quicker to pick up new technologies --- pioneering new behaviours rather than grudgingly adapting to them --- and they're attitudinally more forward-looking, less constrained by the social norms of their predecessors. 

I know all this because I used to be one. 

If someone had studiously observed the hours I spent plugged in to MSN Messenger on our family PC, they could have pieced together the underlying needs that later gave rise to Snapchat, WhatsApp and the rest. 

All of which suggests that opportunity identification should be easy. Trap a few young people, ask them a load of stuff about how they live their lives (or better still, observe them doing so) and profit?

Not so much. 

Consider out current batch of young people: the somewhat hideously branded _Millennials_.
If we took everything your average Millennial said and did at face value, we'd find ourselves designing products and service for the sort of people you find in infographics about Millennials. That is, intransigent and self-involved jerks. 

**Contrary to what the infographics will tell you, not everyone born between 1980 and 2000 is an intransigent, self-involved jerk. **

Some of them aren't even jerks. 

Infographics, thought pieces and conference presentations all illustrate archetypes: designed to reflect the essence of an entire generation in bitesize insight form. It shouldn't be a surprise how few of them succeed. 

Any uniformity in the Millennial cohort comes from a single fact: their date of birth. A common date of birth manifests itself in a couple of interesting ways:

* A common lifestage right now
* A common experience of previous lifestages

****

**What does all this mean for opportunity identification? **

Well, studiously observing young people might provide us with a load of insight about their behaviours, and if we can bear to talk to them we might even learn something about their attitudes. 

Between behaviours and their attitudes, we should be able to piece together some opportunities for new products and services. 

Sounds simple. However: what we won't know, is which of these behaviours and attitudes are intrinsic to their current lifestage (what they're going through right now), and which are a product of their shared generational experience (their life experiences up until now). 

The importance of this distinction might not be immediately apparent, but in the context of a longer-term strategic roadmap it can be critical.

**Are you developing a service for a Millennial, or an 18--34 year old? **

If it's the former, don't be surprised when their lifestage (and therefore their needs and priorities) change pretty drastically over the next few years. Millennials at 40 won't be the same as they were at 20\.

If it's the latter, don't be surprised when the next generational cohort turns up and looks at you with a drastically different set of shared values and attitudes. They spent their formative years in a completely different environment, what do you expect?

All of which shouldn't detract from how much there is to learn from studying Millennials. Or any other generational cohort for that matter.

Just make sure you're untangling insight about their generation from insight about their lifestage, and making any longer term assumptions about product / market fit accordingly. 

Young people definitely know things, the trick is understanding what they mean.
