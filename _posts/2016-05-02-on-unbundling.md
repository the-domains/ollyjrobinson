# On unbundling

Change is coming to Financial Services: a landscape historically defined by the longevity of its key players is being shaken up. 

Barclays can trace their lineage back to the seventeenth century, but new competitors measure time in sprints, not years.

It's a familiar story. Disruption is often characterised as slow-moving incumbents, unable or unwilling to keep up with technological change; nimble new entrants, quicker to identify and seize on new opportunities. 

There's undoubtedly some truth in it, but the reality is a bit more nuanced. 

****

**If disruption was just about effectively harnessing new technology, then start-ups would never win. **

Agility is great, but so are resources. New technology can provide a head start, but if your competitor has deeper pockets and a willingness to invest then sooner or later they'll catch up.

****

**To turn agility and technology into disruption, you need asymmetries.**

As well as enabling innovation, new technology needs to change the basis of competition in the market. It needs to create new core competencies, and make legacy strengths less relevant. 

Which takes us to unbundling: **unbundling generates asymmetries.**

But how do things get unbundled in the first place?

Products and services tend to be a bit like acorns: they start off as something really simple, and grow into something much more complex.

By targeting a narrow, distinct consumer need -- one that's currently met as part of a broader, complex product or service -- you can unbundle it. 

Think about the vast range of not-strictly-news-related stuff you find in a typical daily paper (weather forecasts, job listings, personal ads, crosswords...) and consider the myriad ways people go about meeting those same needs: they've all been unbundled.

****

**Freed from the constraints of a wider proposition, you can go about solving consumer needs in a completely different way. **

New business models open up, asymmetries abound. 

Which takes us (back) to Financial Services: as broad and complex as industries get. 

****

**The historically slow pace of change in finance has traditionally allowed incumbents to adapt to new technology at a leisurely pace. **

For the music industry, the advent of the internet triggered massive disruption, huge revenue loss and an existential crisis. For Financial Services (initially at least) it just provided a neat new way to interact with customers. 

And to be fair, incumbents have (for the most part) handled this transition well. 

While back-end infrastructure often remains a complex web of legacy processes and systems, customer-facing digital experiences are generally quick and intuitive to use.

However, let's not gloss over that back-end complexity. It's reflective of the nature of modern banks, which often provide a number of overlapping products and services through a single customer relationship (current accounts, savings, investments, loans, credit cards, insurance, mortgages etc.) 

****

**This is prime unbundling territory: incumbents with a complex portfolio of products and services, and business models reliant on their interdependencies.**

All of which isn't to say that incumbent Financial Services providers are helpless, or that their disruption is inevitable. 

****

**Unbundling is ultimately a trade-off: **the business models it enables aren't inherently better; they just entail a different set of compromises. 

The user experience might be simpler, but having a single provider across a range of products and services might still be more convenient.

You might be able to optimise your organisational structure around a different set of priorities, but you won't benefit from the same economies of scale as your bundled competitors.

This is what both incumbents and new entrants in Financial Services are wrestling with: which of these these trade-offs worth it, and where are they not? 

****

**Change is definitely coming, but it's too early to tell what shape it will take. **
