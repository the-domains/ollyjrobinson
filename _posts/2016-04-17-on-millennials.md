# On Millennials

Researchers, marketers, pretty much anyone with a passing interest in innovation: we all have one thing in common. When we need to understand how things are changing, we ask young people. 

Young people **know** things. 

Despite the haircuts and the clothes, and the linguistic tics, young people have always constituted a wealth of information about where we're headed. 

They're almost always quicker to pick up new technologies --- pioneering new behaviours rather than grudgingly adapting to them --- and they're attitudinally more forward-looking, less constrained by the social norms of their predecessors. 

**I know all this because I used to be one. 
**

If a diligent researcher had observed the hours I spent plugged in to MSN as a teenager, they should have been able to piece together the underlying needs that enabled Snapchat, WhatsApp and the rest. 

All of which suggests that opportunity identification and service design should be easy. Trap a few young people, ask them some questions about how they live their lives (if possible: observe them actually doing so) and profit?

Not so much. There's an extra layer of complexity here that is rarely talked about, but has significant implications for how we build products and services.

For example, consider out current batch of young people: **Millennials**.

A lot has been written about Millennials, albeit little of any practical value.

The prime culprits for Millennial-overload (infographics, thought pieces, conference presentations) tend to illustrate a Millennial archetype: hoping to reflect the essence of an entire generation in a simplistic, bitesize insight form. 

In reality, any uniformity that does exist in the Millennial cohort comes from a single fact: their date of birth. The wealth of other factors that are tangled up in how individuals make decisions are conveniently overlooked in favour of easy, bland commonalities.

Which isn't to say that we can't learn anything from a shared date of birth.

A common age manifests itself in a couple of interesting ways:

* A common lifestage **right now**
* A common experience of **previous lifestages**

What does this mean for service design? 

Well, studiously observing young people might provide us with a load of insight about their behaviours, and if we can bear to talk to them we might even learn something about their attitudes. 

Between behaviours and attitudes, we should be able to piece together some opportunities for new products and services. 

Sounds simple. However: what we won't know is which of these behaviours and attitudes are intrinsic to their current lifestage (what they're going through right now) and which are a product of their shared generational experience (their life experiences up until now). 

The importance of this distinction might not be immediately apparent, but in the context of a longer-term strategic roadmap it can be critical.

**Are you developing a service for a Millennial, or an 18--34 year old? **

If it's the former, don't be surprised when their lifestage (and therefore their needs and priorities) change pretty drastically over the next few years. Millennials at 35 won't be the same as they were at 30 or 25\.

If it's the latter, don't be surprised when the next generational cohort turns up and looks at your service with a drastically different set of shared values and attitudes. They spent their formative years in a completely different environment, why would you expect anything else?

All of which shouldn't detract from how much we can learn from studying Millennials. Or any other generational cohort for that matter.

Just make sure you're untangling insight about their generation from insight about their lifestage, and making any longer term assumptions about product / market fit accordingly. 

Young people definitely know things, **the trick is understanding what they mean. **
