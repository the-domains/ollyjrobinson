# On Automation

****

Nobody seems able to agree on when humans started using tools, other than to say it was a really, really long time ago. 

The further back we try to trace them, the harder it becomes to differentiate between human artifacts (early tools) and naturally-occurring objects (pointy rocks). 

The actual date is pretty much irrelevant anyway: the key point is that the relationship between us and our technology (in the broadest possible sense of the word) goes way, way back. 

Everything in-between, from the wheel to autonomous drones, can be split into two broad categories:

* Technologies of **Enhancement**

* Technologies of **Automation**

Enhancement technologies **augment** our capabilities, allowing us to achieve things we could never achieve without them.

Automation technologies **substitute **our capabilities, freeing us up to focus our attention elsewhere.

The aeroplane enhanced our capabilities; auto-pilot replaces them. 

Both have tended to provide us with broad net benefits at a societal level: whether by enhancing our capabilities or automating them, they allow us to achieve more collectively. 

However, **automation doesn't always benefit us at an individual level.**

Consider your job: when your capabilities are augmented by a new technology (think the advent of the internet) it usually means significant change and upheaval for you professionally, but it rarely threatens your entire livelihood.

Now consider what it means to have your capabilities replaced by technology. Shit gets real. 

Headlines about the rise of machine learning and AI would have us believe that this is new news, but a **tension between the societal benefits and individual hardships brought about by substitutive technologies can be traced back through history.**

As early as 1788 the British Government was passing legislation to punish people for sabotaging the mechanical looms that were replacing their jobs in textile production, and the more widespread 19th century Luddite movement was a structured, organised embodiment of the same sentiment.

Stock frames, spinning frames and power looms were destroying livelihoods: obviously the livelihoods would fight back. 

Or consider agriculture: for long periods of human history farming employed entire populations (give or take a few spongers living in castles). Over time, it's transitioned to a (largely) machine industry, and the labour freed up now underpins the rest of our economy, generating a huge net societal benefit. 

Agriculture, though, also presents a more cautionary tale. While the human labour freed up by technology was quickly reallocated (in epochal terms at least) other farm labour didn't get so lucky. As the economist Gregory Clark points out in _A Farewell to Alms, _the horse never really recovered from the arrival of the internal combustion engine. Their capabilities were substituted out of the economy, unable (rather than unwilling) to be reallocated elsewhere.

**Automation giveth, and automation taketh away**

So what lessons should our contemporary selves take from this historical precedent?

Thus far, we've proved a more versatile bunch than our equine equivalents: **our skills are more flexible and our potential more malleable. **As a result, the automation of human capabilities has generally worked out fine for us (at least in the longer term). We just keep creating new industries, and different jobs. 

****

From the fields to the factories and from blue collars to white; we've always managed to stay one step ahead of substitutive technologies.

This raises two (somewhat selfishly) important questions:

* Are knowledge workers immune from these repeated cycles of technological substitution? **Is there something unique about the jobs we do that will prevent them from being automated?**

* And if not, what happens next? Will our substituted labour (again) be reallocated, and if so where?

(Ok, I realise that was four questions).

If the former is hard to answer definitively, the latter is nigh on impossible. 

****

**Blue collar workers couldn't predict the rise of white collar professions any more than farm labourers could predict factories.**

From our current vantage point, anyone making detailed predictions about the labour needs of future economic cycles is at best optimistic, and at worse disingenuous. 

The former question is more approachable, at least from an individual perspective. We know what our jobs entail from day-to-day, and we can reflect on our skills and capabilities in the context of where technology is (and isn't) making strides. 

We're still very much in the realm of educated guesses though. Even technologists can't agree on the potential limits of technology, let alone the more sceptically-inclined. 

Instead, perhaps what history teaches us more than anything else is to distrust the status quo. The one thing we can be certain of is that the future economy will be different to the current one, whether we're part of it not.
