The most dangerous competitors are the asymmetric ones. 

They're the ones that don't just make your market more competitive, they flip it upside-down and inside-out. 

They don't just rock the boat, they capsize it. 

They're also unnervingly hard to spot.

Disruption by asymmetric competitors can come from start-ups within your category, or non-traditional competitors from adjacent categories.

Lacking your resources and your category understanding, they compete instead by changing the basis of competition.

By differentiating on new features, they're able to commoditise existing ones. The existing ones where your core competencies lie.

This means they don't register as a direct threat, and can even initially benefit you (e.g. bringing new consumers into the market).

An immediate competitive response is often delayed in favour of continuing to focus on the core competencies your customers value, all while the new entrant is learning and building rapidly along the new competitive axis. Entrenching their advantage.

By the time the changing basis of competition is acknowledged, it's too late to effectively react.

This process is often enabled by changing technology, and the history of technology is littered with case studies of asymmetrical disruption.

If your category is currently undergoing significant technological change (automotive, health, finance: I'm looking at you) it's probably already happening. 

So what should you be doing about it? 

Bare minimum: you should be evaluating asymmetric threats on an ongoing basis.

**One: look inside yourself**

To identify asymmetric threats, you first need to understand what business you're in. 

This is not the same as the things you sell.  

What are the underlying needs that your customers use you to address?

What are the problems you're helping them resolve? 

**Two: look around**

Seek out all the other things people are using to resolve those same problems. 

This is not just a list of your direct competitors. 

Where are the start-ups in your category clustering?

What's changing in adjacent categories?

Are there emergent consumer attitudes or behaviours that hint at new, different ways of addressing these needs? 

Ignore current scale, and focus on how effectively the needs are being met. 

**Three: look ahead**

Consider directional trends. 

In your category, what is being commoditised and where are the new opportunities to differentiate? 

In terms of wider consumer behaviour, how are relationships with brands evolving and what role is technology playing? 

In the context of all of this: how do your core competencies compare to those of asymmetric competitors? 

Who is aligned better, and what does that mean for the evolution of your market? 

**Four: stop looking and do something**

Building new core competencies is hard, and it takes a long time. 

Ultimately, you need to use all the information you've collected to spot the right asymmetric threats, and you need to do it early enough to buy the time for an effective competitive response.
