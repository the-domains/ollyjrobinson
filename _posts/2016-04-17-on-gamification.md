# On Gamification

As researchers, we have a responsibility (whether we like it or not) for the people taking part in our research. 

This is partly about a basic duty of care, but there's also an oft-overlooked and more intrinsically selfish motivation: **more engaged people tend to provide better quality data. **

Can Gamification help?

Defined by Wikipedia as "the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts," the basic concepts and terminology have been liberally thrown around for five years or so. 

While this makes it pretty antiquated in Gartner Hype Cycle terms, in the somewhat more pedestrian world of market research it still counts as relatively nascent. 

**Done well, **there is plenty of evidence to show that the right game mechanic used in the right context can have a really powerful effect on respondent engagement. Some of it is in the public domain, more still is locked away in agencies.

**Done badly, **you won't be surprised to learn that a thin veneer of points and badges thrown over the top of a research activity will have little to no impact on the engagement of the people doing it (and in the worst cases, it might even make things worse). 

So the trick is not doing it badly. 

Let's start with first principles: what motivates people to take part in research? 

The obvious (or at least, the most honest and frequent) answer might be money, but it's not always the case. There are a whole load of other motivators here:

* **Influence: **an opportunity to help drive change 

* **Ego: **an opportunity to have your voice heard 

* **Education:** an opportunity to learn something 

* **Experience:** an opportunity to try something 

This list isn't intended to be exhaustive, nor are these motivations necessarily mutually exclusive. The point is: people take part in research activities for a whole host of reasons, and how we apply Gamification needs to be tailored accordingly. 

For example, the optimal game mechanic will be different for someone only taking part in research for a financial incentive vs. someone interested in learning or trying something new. 

The scope of gamified elements can also scale up or down. 

There are some very simple mechanics that can be applied to a basic question that will produce surprising uplift in the amount of detail participants provide. 

For example, rather than asking someone what they'd like your brand to do about something, put them in the shoes of your CEO and ask them what they would do about it if they were in charge for a day. 

At the other end of the spectrum are more tailored approaches that can require heavy investment in bespoke programming and interface design. Significant sums that can double or triple the budget of a research study.

Ultimately, the trick is to avoid thinking in functional terms from the outset. The most effective Gamification projects I've been involved in started with a clear understanding of some core questions: 

* **What are the objectives** we are hoping to achieve by applying gamification? 

* **Who are our audience** and what are their motivations for participating?

These need to be defined at the start, revisited throughout the design process, and any results tested against them (and where necessary, iterated on accordingly). 

The less effective projects were typically those that either didn't have a clear objective in mind (Gamification for the sake of Gamification) or weren't designed with a specific audience in mind (add-some-points-and-badges-and-see-what-happens). 

Ultimately, it's not to dissimilar to any other research: know what you're trying to achieve, design accordingly, test and learn, and continually evaluate.
